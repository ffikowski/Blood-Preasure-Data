# Blood Preasure Data (12/21)
- We developed and analyzed various predictive models to determine whether or not an individual has blood pressure issues
- The primary models utilized were logistic regression and random forest
- The differentiation parameters for both models were optimized based on accuracy and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
- For the random forest model, parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and the number of potential split variables at each node were meticulously adjusted
